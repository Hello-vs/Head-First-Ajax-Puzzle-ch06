Modified a bit of the logic to utilize objects for the key-value pair for dictionary lookups. 

Created my copy of  O'Reilly Head First Ajax A Brain-Friendly Guide Author Rebecca M. Riordan ch06 to modify called testfifteen-puzzle.html and script file: testfifteen.js

In chp06 I created a dictionary like object to save a snap shot of each play's latest location of number cells and empty cell on the board.
This allows for indexing to check for wins and for vaild cell moves and empty cell location.
